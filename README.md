# ReloadReminder
World of Warcraft addon for the Hardcore community - reminds you to /reload to help avoid loss of HC progress!

## What does this addon do?
Basically, just spams you to reload your UI as often as you want it to; audibly and in chat.

## Credits
This is my first WoW addon, I hacked it together in an evening so don't exepect anything too fancy!
